        <b>accelerator board</b> - a printed circuit board added to the 
        computer to replace the central processing unit with a faster one.
        </br></br>

        <b>adapter</b> - the circuitry required to support a particular 
        device; adapters can be built into the main circuitry of a computer 
        or they can be separate add-ons that come in the form of expansion 
        boards.
        </br></br>

        add-in - a component you can add to a computer or other 
        device to increase its capabilities; add-ins can increase memory or add 
        graphics or communications capabilities to a computer.
        </br></br>

        add-on - refers to a product designed to complement another 
        product; there are numerous add-on boards available that you can plug
        into a personal computer to give it additional capabilities; another 
        term for add-on board is expansion board.
        </br></br>

        ATA - acronym for Advanced Technology Attachment, a disk drive
        implementation that integrates the controller on the disk drive itself.

        backplane - a circuit board containing sockets into which other 
        circuit boards can be plugged in. In the context of PCs, the term backplane 
        refers to the large circuit board that contains sockets for expansion cards.

        BIOS - an acronym for Basic Input/Output System; the BIOS is 
        built-in software containing all the code required to control the keyboard,
        display screen, disk drives, serial communications, and a number of other
        functions.

        chassis - a metal frame that serves as the structural support for 
        electronic components; very computer system requires at least one chassis to 
        house the circuit boards and wiring.

        chip - a small piece of semiconducting material (usually silicon)
        on which an integrated circuit is embedded.

        chipset - a number of integrated circuits designed to perform one 
        or more related functions; newer chipsets generally include functions 
        provided by two or more older chipsets; the term is often used to refer 
        to the core functionality of a motherboard.

        CMOS - abbreviation of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor; a 
        widely used type of semiconductor.

        COTS - short for Commercial Off-The-Shelf, an adjective that describes
