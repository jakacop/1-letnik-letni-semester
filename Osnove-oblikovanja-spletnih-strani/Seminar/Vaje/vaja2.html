        <h2>Using Lists</h2>

        <p>
            Web pages normally contain text information arranged in paragraphs. For 
            display variation, though, information can be presented as "lists," that
            is, as single-spaced items separated and indented from surrounding content. 
            There are three types of lists:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <a href="unordered_lists.html">Unordered lists</a>  </br>
            <a href="ordered_lists.html">Ordered lists</a> </br>
            <a href="definition_lists.html">Definition lists</a> </br>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>
            (Click the above links to open pages where you can view examples of these 
            lists.) Any of the lists can be nested inside each other as shown by the 
            example: <a href="nested_lists.html">Nested lists</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to these built-in lists, an indented list of items can be 
            formatted inside a blockquote tag using a line-break tag to end each item. 
            This technique is used above to format the links.
        </p>
