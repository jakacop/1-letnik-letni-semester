            Using Spans and Divisions
        </h2>

        <p>
            Spans and divisions are containers for enclosing text and other page elements 
            for the purpose of applying styles to them. The following two paragraphs, for 
            example, are enclosed inside a single division to which an embedded style 
            declaration is applied. Both paragraphs inherit the division's styles.
        </p>

        <div id="offset">
            <hr/>
            <p>
                A <span class="rdec">span</span> tag is an in-line tag normally used to enclose a short string of text 
                in order to apply styles to individual characters, words, phrases, sentences, 
                or other text less than a paragraph in length.
            </p>

            <p>
                A <span class="rdec">division</span> tag is a block-level tag used to enclose blocks of text and other 
                page elements in order to apply common styles to them. A division causes a 
                line break before and after its contained content.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="offset">
            <hr/>
        </div>

        <p>
            Neither spans nor divisions should be styled with tag selectors. Rather, 
            use class selectors, id selectors, or in-line style sheets to apply styling 
            to the content they surround.
