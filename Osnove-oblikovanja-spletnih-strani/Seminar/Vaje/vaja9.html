        <p>
            Transistors consist of three terminals; the <b>source</b>, the <b>gate</b>, and the <b>drain</b>. Both the source and the drain are negatively charged. When voltage is applied to the gate, electrons are attracted to the area under the gate forming a channel between the source and the drain across which electrons can flow.
        </p>

        <p>
            When positive voltage is applied to the drain, electrons are pulled from the source to the drain. In this state the transistor is "on." When the voltage at the gate is removed, the pathway is broken, electrons cease to flow, and the transistor is turned "off." This on/off, <b>binary</b>, condition of a transistor can be used to represent "0" and "1" states, giving rise to the coding system used in all computers to represent data and the instructions that process them. Millions of these transistor are etched onto silicon plates to produce <b>microprocessors</b> that run modern computers.

        <h4 style="clear: right;">Binary number system</h4>

        <p>
            In order to represent data such as decimal numbers and letters, combinations of these binary digits, or bits, can be used. Within a group of eight bits, called a byte, there are 256 combinations of 0s and 1s, more than enough to represent the ten decimal digits and 52 upper- and lower-case alphabetic characters. The following illustration shows how the decimal digits are represented in binary.
        </p>

        <p>
            The decimal value represented by a binary number depends on the place value assigned to each of the bit positions. In a binary number system, the value at each position, moving from right to left, is given by increasing powers of 2. Therefore, the eight positions have the place values 2<sup>0</sup>, 2<sup>1</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>3</sup>, 2<sup>4</sup>, 2<sup>5</sup>, 2<sup>6</sup>, and 2<sup>7</sup> as shown above.
        </p>

        <p>
            A decimal number is represented by placing the counting digit 1 in those positions where the place values add up to the decimal value. For example, decimal number 7 is represented in binary as 00000111. The sum of the place values across the eight positions is (0 x 128) + (0 x 64) + (0 x 32) + (0 x 16) + (0 x 8) + (1 x 4) + (1 x 2) + (1 x 1) = 7.
