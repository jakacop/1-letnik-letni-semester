        <h1>Structuring a Web Page</h1>

        <p>
            Web pages often present text information organized into paragraphs. A 
            paragraph is a block of text separated from other page content with a single 
            blank line appearing before and after the text. The text is also word-wrapped 
            inside the browser window.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Paragraphs also can be formatted as blockquoted text, as in this paragraph. 
            Here, text is indented a fixed number of spaces (about 40 pixels) from the 
            left and right margins of the page.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Other methods of structuring text include
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            bulleted lists </br>
            numbered lists </br>
            definition lists </br>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            It is important to remember that XHTML tags bring overall structure to a Web 
            page. They identify blocks of information content and arrange them on the 
            page in a logical, readable manner.

            NOTE: XHTML tag are not used to style text, only to bring order and structure
            to page content. Styling of text characters takes place through the use of 
            style sheets.
